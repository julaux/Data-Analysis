# EXPERIENCE LEVEL PREDICTION OF A GYM MEMBER USING PREDICTIVE ANALYTIS MODELS

Objective:
+ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the dataset.
+ Apply the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning from an available dataset.

The project is divided into the following sections, saved in a jupyter notebook in this repository.

1. Dataframe exploratory.
2. Calculate a basic statistical exploration.
3. Pre-proccesing the data.
4. Estimate distributions for numerical and categorical variables.
5. Estimate a heatmap plot.
6. Visualization by scatter plots of some numerical variables segmented by gender and experience level.
7. Predictive model using Machine Learning and evaluation of multiple model choices.

## Part 1
Identify the types of variables contained in our dataset. We will use Python modules to import the external dataset in order to familiarise ourselves with the data, to get a good grasp of the data and think about how to handle the data in different ways.

## Part 2
A basic statistical exploration helps to identify parameters such as media, mean, standard deviation, etc.

## Part 3
Determine NA's in the variables, and if it is neccesary to transform categorical variables to numerical variables in ordinal or nominal way.

## Part 4
Numerical distributions helps to reprent the discret variables, in this case, segmented by gender and experience level.

## Part 5
A heat map is useful for identifying the relationship between multiple variables in the dataset, from positive to negative correlation.

## Part 6
For this project, each scatterplot is segmented by gender and level of experience to see how these two nominal variables may influence the other variables.

## Part 7
Determine which machine learning model provides a better error and experience level determination based on the other variables; this model will be a classifier model.
