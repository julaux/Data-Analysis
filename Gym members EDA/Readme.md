# EXPERIENCE LEVEL PREDICTION OF A GYM MEMBER USING PREDICTIVE ANALYTIS MODELS

Objective:
+ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the dataset.
+ Apply the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning from an available dataset.

The project is divided into the following sections, saved in a jupyter notebook in this repository.

1. Dataframe exploratory.
2. Determine categorical and numerical variables, and calculate a basic stats exploration.
3. Pre-proccesing the data.
4. Estimate distributions for numerical and categorical variables.
5. Estimate a heatmap plot.
6. Visualization by scatter plots of some numerical variables segmented by gender and experience level.
